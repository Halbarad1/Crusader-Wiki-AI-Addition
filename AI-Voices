In Order to change AI voicelines, you need to go to Stronghold Crusader/fx/speech. You can find voiclines over there, sorted by a specific prefix (e. g. all voicelines of the Wolf start with "wf_"). Also, you should change the announcement (e. g. "A message from the Wolf"). Those voicelines start with "General_Message". The following table shows you where to find specific voicelines:
